Solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

This year, I'm using python 3 and streaming the solutions at https://twitch.tv/tonytwitch.

Advent of Code is an annual programming contest hosted by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). It's for fun and there are no prizes other than bragging rights.

Each night (midnight ET) from Dec 1 to Dec 25, there is a two part programming problem released. My goal is to try and be in the top 1000 finishers each night. The problems become progressivly harder as the month progresses. During the first few days, I expect to take ~10min solving the problems and hope to finish each day in under an hour. If [history](https://github.com/idealisms/adventofcode2020) is any guide, there are normally a few days it takes me a few hours and one day that I give up and go to sleep.
