Solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

This year, I'm using python 3 and streaming the solutions at https://twitch.tv/tonytwitch.

Advent of Code is an annual programming contest hosted by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). It's for fun and there are no prizes other than bragging rights. Each night (midnight ET) from Dec 1 to Dec 25, there is a two part programming problem released with each day getting progressively harder. My goal is to try and be in the top 1000 finishers each night.


My personal stats:

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
